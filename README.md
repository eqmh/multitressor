# Contains script and some data tables for FRESCA Module 1 multi-stressor analysis

## **Meeting notes:**

**February 9th 2024: Dan Otis and Enrique Montes**
- We will use [Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) SST Analysis](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplMURSST41.html) for thermal stress distributions
- Dan will upload 1 km MODIS Aqua chlorophyll-a, nFLH, turbidity, and Alagae Bloom Index data for the entire Gulf of Mexico (2002-present) to an ERDDAP server
- Dan will compile freshwater discharge data for: Caloosahatchee River, Shark River, Manatee River, Peace River, and maybe other.
- Goals:
  - Spatially characterize stressors
  - Generate products showing extent and timing of stressor events: heatwaves, cold spells, freshwater discharge, red tides, others
  - Define stressor thresholds that can be used for model parameterization
  - Match ABI data with red tide records
