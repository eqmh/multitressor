### Satellite Data for FRESCA Project

Satellite-based datasets for the FRESCA project:
USF has compiled several satellite-based datasets, including ocean color, sea surface temperature and biogeographic seascapes for waters around South Florida. A Github repository was created to share code among the project team. Details on data products along with links to data and the Github repository are given below.

#### Data Types (details on each are given below):
1. Ocean color: from MODIS, VIIRS and PACE sensors
2. Sea Surface Temperature (SST): from Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) SST Analysis fv04.1
3. Biogeographic Seascapes: Served by NOAA Coastwatch
4. Net Primary Productivity: From Oregon State University Ocean Productivity Lab  

ERDDAP Link for all datasets:

### OCEAN COLOR
Data are obtained from NASA's Ocean Biology Distributed Active Archive Center (OB-DAAC):  
https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/

Data is ingested, composited, gridded and served via ERDDAP at USF
