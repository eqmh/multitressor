## Satellite Data for FRESCA Project

Satellite-based datasets for the FRESCA project:
USF has compiled several satellite-based datasets, including ocean color, sea surface temperature and biogeographic seascapes for waters around South Florida. A Github repository was created to share code among the project team. Details on data products along with links to data and the Github repository are given below.

#### Data Types (details on each are given below):
1. Ocean color: from MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS-SNPP and PACE-OCI sensors
2. Sea Surface Temperature (SST): from Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) SST Analysis fv04.1 and VIIRS-SNPP
3. Biogeographic Seascapes: Based on MODIS-Aqua data and served by NOAA Coastwatch
4. Net Primary Productivity: From Oregon State University Ocean Productivity Lab

#### NOTE on MODIS-Aqua: MODIS-Aqua is at the end of its operational life and has exhibited degraded data quality since the end of 2022. While there have been data reprocessings bu OB-DAAC to improve data quality, MODIS will be decommissioned at some point in 2026. We will continue to serve these products with reprocessed data as long as they are available due to the long MODIS data record. Users should plan to transition to using products from VIIRS-SNPP and PACE-OCI. Please feel free to contact Dan Otis at USF with questions: dotis@usf.edu

### OCEAN COLOR
Data are obtained from NASA's Ocean Biology Distributed Active Archive Center (OB-DAAC):  
https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/

Data is ingested, composited, gridded and served via ERDDAP at USF  

Within each Ocean Color file, there are the following products:
1. chlor_a (chlorophyll-a concentration in mg m^-3) - proxy for phytoplankton biomass
2. chlor_a_clim (climatology of chlorophyll-a concentration based on data from 2003-2019 for MODIS-Aqua and 2013-2019 for VIIRS)
3. chlor_a_anom (anomaly of chlorophyll-a concentration; chlor_a_clim subtracted from chlor_a)
4. Rrs_667 (remote sensing reflectance at 667nm in sr ^-1) - proxy for suspended sediments
5. Rrs_667_clim (climatology of Rrs_667 based on data from 2003-2019 for MODIS-Aqua and 2013-2019 for VIIRS)
6. Rrs_667_anom (anomaly of Rrs_667; Rrs_667_clim subtracted from Rrs_667)

##### The following products are included with MODIS-Aqua files only
10. ABI (Algal Bloom Index in mW cm^2 um^-1 sr^-1) - proxy for potential algal bloom conditions
11. ABI_clim (climatology of ABI based on data from 2003-2019 for MODIS-Aqua and 2013-2019 for VIIRS)
12. ABI_anom (anomaly of ABI; ABI_clim subtracted from ABI)

### DYNAMIC BIOGEOGRAPHIC SEASCAPES
Dynamic seascapes are classified using multivariate satellite data and describe basin and gyre scale features and seasonal boundary shifts. They are obtained from [NOAA's Coastwatch](https://cwcgom.aoml.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/noaa_aoml_seascapes_8day.graph). A description of seascape classes can be found [HERE](https://shiny.marinebon.app/seascapes/classes.html).
The seascapes served here are based on MODIS-Aqua data (-90N to 90N; -180E 180E)  
ERDDAP Link: http://131.247.136.200:8080/erddap/griddap/noaa_aoml_seascapes_8day.graph

There is a version based on VIIRS-SNPP and Sentinel-3 OLCI data that is served by NOAA Coastwatch

### NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY
Net primary productivity products are calculated using the Vertically Generalized Productivity Model (VGPM) based on MODIS-Aqua data at 9-km spatial resolution (-90N to 90N; -180E to 180E)
These products are from the Oregon State Ocean Productivity Lab (http://orca.science.oregonstate.edu/index.php)
