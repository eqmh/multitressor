### Satellite Data for FRESCA Project

Satellite-based datasets for the FRESCA project:
USF has compiled several satellite-based datasets, including ocean color, sea surface temperature and biogeographic seascapes for waters around South Florida. A Github repository was created to share code among the project team. Details on data products along with links to data and the Github repository are given below.

#### Data Types:
1. Ocean color: from MODIS, VIIRS and PACE sensors
2. Sea surface temperature: from Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) SST Analysis fv04.1
3. Biogeographic Seascapes: Served by NOAA Coastwatch
4. Net Primary Productivity: From Oregon State University Ocean Productivity Lab  
Details on each of these data types is given below

Data is ingested, composited, gridded and served via ERDDAP at USF  

ERDDAP Link for all datasets:
